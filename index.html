      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        At the Elf Hiring Service, we offer you the finest in holiday helpers.
        Our "elves" are expert gift wrappers, tree decorators, and festive event
        planners.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important Note:</strong> We are NOT gnomes. We repeat, WE ARE
        NOT GNOMES! Our magical helpers may look like gnomes, but they are
        professionally trained elves. Any resemblance to gnomes is purely
        coincidental (and not something they like to talk about).

      <h3>We Are NOT Gnomes!</h3>
      <p>
        Do not believe the rumors. We are not gnomes. We have absolutely no
        interest in garden decoration or sneaking around in people's yards. We
        are focused on the holiday season and everything that brings cheer to
        your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our “elves” are here for all your holiday needs, from organizing gift
        lists to helping you host the perfect Christmas party. They may have
        beards, but no, they are not gnomes. No, they don't live underground.
        No, they don't eat mushrooms. Please stop asking.
